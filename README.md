# Bioreactor Dashboard
This project pulls bioreactor metrics from a postgresql database and displays them as a minamilist cluster of graphs. There is also a feature to download the data as a CSV files. Both the front-end and back-end are coded with Python, and dependencies and deployment are handled with docker. The streamlit and matplot libraries are used for the front-end display and graphs.
